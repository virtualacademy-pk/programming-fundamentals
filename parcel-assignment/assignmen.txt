Case Study
Develop an application in C++ that should allow the user of application to enter the receipt number,
sender name, sender address, receiver name, receiver address, parcel weight,
 shipment basic charges, fee per gram and additional fee per gram of parcel (in case of urgent).
 Default weight limit without extra charges is 900 grams.
 After getting required information generate a shipment receipt and display on console screen.

The formula to calculate total charges will be:
Scenario 1
===============
Total-charges = Basic Charges
    For example if basic charges = 500 and per gram overweight = 2
    Total Weight: 850
    Total Charges = 300
    However, if weight is greater than 900g, then:
    Total charges = Basic Charges + (Per-gram charges for overweight * overweight)
    Note: overweight = Total weight â€“ 900.
    For example if basic charges = 500 and per gram overweight = 2
    Total Weight: 950
    overweight: 950 -900 = 30
    Total Charges = 300 + ( 2 * 30) = 360
Scenario 2
============
Urgent parcel has two specialized attributes i.e.
 Per-gram charges for overweight (this value will be entered by user)
 and Urgent service charges per gram for overweight (this value will be entered by user)
   The formula to calculate total charges will be:
        Total charges =  (Basic Charges + (50% of basic charges for urgent service))
        For example if basic charges = 300 and per gram overweight = 2
            Total Weight: 870
            Total Charges = 300 +  150 = 750
    However, if weight is greater than 900g, then:
    Total charges =  (Basic Charges + (50% of basic charges for urgent service)) +
     ((Per-gram charges for overweight + Urgent service charges per gram)* overweight)
     For example if basic charges = 300 and per gram overweight = 2 , urgent service per extra gram 3
                 Total Weight: 940
                 Overweight = 940 -900 = 40
                 Total Charges = (300 +  150)  +  ((2 + 3 ) * 40)
                 Total Charges = 450 + (5*40) = 450 + 200 = 650
